The results from both the hypothesis testing and logistic regression indicate that the explanatory variables are not correlated to the response variable. The old page was found to outperform the new page by very slight and probably a practically insignificant amount in our observed sample. Since the new page did not outperform the old page, we fail to reject the null Hypothesis. Both the information provided by the variable that indicates which page the user saw and their country were weak indicators in prediciting the target response variable (whether the user converted or not). The higher order interaction terms also did not encompass any new significant information to allow the variables to be good predictors**\n",
